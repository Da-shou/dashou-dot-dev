## Simple blogging platform to post updates about my work.

### Summary

This is a small web developement project where I will do my best to create a functional blogging platform to post updates about my projects. 
The main website will contain a quick presentation of me and my interests, and contain a list of the different projects I have worked on and/or have finished working on. 
The blog post will contain titles, tags, summaries, content (text, images, videos, audio) and comment space.
